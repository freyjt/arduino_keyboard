PROJECT:    arduino_keyboard
PURPOSE:    This project takes the input from an AT Protocol keyboad
            and decodes it, outputing the keystrokes through an Arduino leonardo
            to USB, making outdated keyboards appear to run natively.
LISCENSE:   gnu. see LISCENSE file in project for details
PROGRAMMER: Joshua T. Frey

HOW TO USE: Key connector pinouts can be easily foud online.
            There are 4 used lines on the connector (whether 5 or 6 pin DIN)

            +5v - on the keyboards I've tested this can be connected directly to
                  the voltage from the arduino.
            CLK - the keyboard generates it's on clock signal for data transfer
                  the pin for this connection is obvious in the code, and should
                  be checked and adjusted accordingly
            DATA- same method as clock
            GND - can be connected straight to ground

            Simply hook everything up and program the MCU with an Arduino IDE compatible
            compiler, your keyboard should work.

KNOWN ISSUES:  print screen and pause break are not decoding yet, and hitting these keys
               will require a restart of the MCU

               full two way communication between the arduino and keyboard is not implemented.
               As such, the lock lights will not turn on with the lock. Also, errors are fatal
               and will require an MCU restart
